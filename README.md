# Status Page

This basic site contains the status page for all my sites and projects. It has two main pieces:
- The status page from Uptime Robot.
- Status of the timers on my server.

I host this site using GitHub Pages, so the status page doesn't rely on the server itself.

The Uptime Robot status page can be viewed separately at https://stats.uptimerobot.com/pol1Gh9Wx4 in the unlikely event that GitHub Pages is down.
