# Status Page

This basic site contains the status page for all my sites and projects. It has two main pieces:
- The status page from Uptime Robot (which we just link to).
- Status of the timers on my server.

I host this site using GitHub Pages, so the status page doesn't rely on the server itself.

In the unlikely event that GitHub Pages is down, or the even more unlikely event that DNS is busted, you can access the Uptime Robot status page directly at https://stats.uptimerobot.com/pol1Gh9Wx4.
